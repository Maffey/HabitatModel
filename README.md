# Habitat Model
This Python project implements a very simple model of species' habitat using map/grid.
Using just food and different, mutated animals the model intends to simulate crude evolution based on basic attributes of animals.

Project is far from finished, lacks pretty much everything except classes for the needed objects. Unfortunately abandoned, waiting for another day to see the light, after I gather enough knowledge and will (mostly will) to put this all together.
